dropzone-gwt
============

This is a dropzone.js GWT wrapper, somewhat usable.

---

## What?

This bundles [Dropzone.js](http://www.dropzonejs.com/) into a small GWT lib, injecting it's Javascript and CSS files during runtime and wrapping the JSNI calls, to the Dropzone.js code, making the use of the component convenient.

##How?

Instantiate a `com.twocentsforthoughts.dropzone.client.Dropzone` widget, and add to a `Container`, see the magic happen.
